The plugin mounts its own endpoints at /api/auth/admin/*, and its middleware authorizes on these statements alone: it has no notion of rank, of who the actor is relative to the target, or of the last owner. Hand an admin the stock adminAc and one request to /api/auth/admin/set-role makes them an owner, bans an owner, or resets an owner's password, and every rule in @/access becomes a comment. Verified: it did exactly that before this was narrowed.
