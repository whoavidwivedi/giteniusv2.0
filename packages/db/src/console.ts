The exception is .github/scripts/console-roles.ts, which cannot import this package from the repo root and so restates the three rung sentences; tests/github/scripts/console-roles.test.ts fails if the two drift apart.
// Each one is a sentence that stands on its own: the Action column is a filter, not the only thing telling you what happened, and a line pasted somewhere else has no column beside it at all.
// A null from is an account that had no rung at all.
// A rung set to what it already was is not refused anywhere, and it still stamps role_set_at, which is the record that stops a later allowlist rule lifting the account. So it is worth a line, just not one claiming a change: it says the rung was decided, which is what actually happened.
