// Single source of truth for docs structure and metadata. Groups are ordered arrays; each item is a single-key record keyed by a page URL (value = metadata) or a subgroup label (value = nested items). Keys are literal URLs ("/docs" = the docs index).
// title/description are synced into each MDX's frontmatter by the web/next build/dev (.github/scripts/docs.ts); `label` overrides the sidebar label (defaults to title). Group name is independent of the page URL, so pages regroup without changing links.
