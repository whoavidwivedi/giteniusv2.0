# Shadcn Sync

`bun run shadcn:update` tears the whole `ui/` layer down to the registry and re-applies every local override programmatically. It is **self-reconciling**: a clean tree goes in, a clean tree comes back. The only diff you should ever see is **the residual**, a genuine upstream change to a component.

Under the hood the command is `bash .github/scripts/shadcn-update.sh && bun i`. The script, from `web/next`, runs `rm -rf components.json src/components/ui` -> `shadcn init` -> `shadcn add -a`; then, at repo root, `.github/scripts/shadcn-customize.ts` -> `bun run format` (oxfmt). The trailing `bun i` belongs to the wrapper, not the script: it reconciles the lockfile after `customize.ts` restores it from HEAD.

## Procedure

1. **Run** on a clean tree: `bun run shadcn:update`. It refuses on a dirty **blast radius**, so commit or stash first.
2. **Review** `git diff`; expect it empty. Every non-empty hunk must be a real registry change to a component, never override churn.
3. **Type-check**: `cd web/next && bun run build` (or `bun run check-types`), which covers every `.tsx`, including unused ones like `calendar.tsx`. Must pass.
4. **Commit** only the residual registry deltas.

## What `shadcn-customize.ts` reconciles

Two strategies. Each guard is idempotent and throws when its target is absent, so an upstream shape change **fails loudly** rather than silently dropping an override.

**Restore from HEAD** (`RESTORE` list), files the sync re-scaffolds but we own outright:

- `bun.lock` + `web/next/package.json`: `add -a` rewrites deps off `catalog:` to pinned ranges; the root `catalog` is the source of truth, so reset to HEAD.
- `web/next/src/app/layout.tsx`: `init` injects `next/font/google`; we self-host instead (see the `fonts` skill).
- `web/next/src/lib/utils.ts`: `init` drops the repo helpers `slugify` and `isActive` (and internal `generateId`).

**Patch in place**, registry components we extend, located by AST shape with ts-morph (so attribute or param reordering can't break them) plus one guarded string swap for CSS:

- `button.tsx`, Base UI render wiring (`render`, `nativeButton={!render}`, `render={render}`)
- `checkbox.tsx`, the indeterminate state: Base UI sets `data-indeterminate` (never `data-checked`), so the registry's check-only indicator paints a partial selection identically to a checked one. Fills the box on `data-indeterminate` and swaps the glyph to a minus. The guard tests for the patch before the target, since the swapped-in ternary still contains the `<RiCheckLine />` it replaced.
- `spinner.tsx`, `React.ComponentProps<RemixiconComponentType>` typing
- `sidebar.tsx`, optional `children` label on `SidebarTrigger`
- `globals.css`, `--font-sans` repointed at the brand DM Sans variable (`--font-dm-sans`), and both `--sidebar` lines (`:root` + `.dark`) flushed to `var(--background)` (PR #566)

`calendar.tsx` carries no override and tracks the registry as-is (we pin `react-day-picker` to `^10`; the registry component is v10-compatible).

## Notes

- **Add overrides only through `shadcn-customize.ts`**, never by hand, because `add -a` overwrites `ui/` every run. Extend the `RESTORE` list, or add a fail-loud ts-morph patch (or guarded CSS string swap).
- `add -a` re-adds ALL components, so unused ones (`calendar.tsx`, `chart.tsx`, …) reappear every run. That is expected; do not delete them to chase a dead-code report.
